# Second Master Project

All work done in this project relates to the following paper: [Learning interactions between Rydberg atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12019) by Anna Dawid, Olivier Simard, et al.

Supervisor: **Anna Dawid**

To-do list:
- [x] Benchmark the dmrg method from ITensors (Experiment_1 and plot from imgs)
- [ ] Generate datasets based on the paper (20 000 + 2000 per size):
    - [x] 4x4 (χDMRG = 80)
    - [x] 5x5 (χDMRG = 90)
    - [ ] 6x6 (χDMRG = 100)
    - [x] 7x6 (χDMRG = 110, only test dataset)
    - [x] 7x7 (χDMRG = 120, only test dataset)
    - [x] 8x7 (χDMRG = 130, only test dataset)
    - [x] 8x8 (χDMRG = 140, only test dataset)
    - [ ] 9x8 (χDMRG = 150, only test dataset)
    - [ ] 9x9 (χDMRG = 160, only test dataset)
